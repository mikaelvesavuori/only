Only is not supported by Being, but is frequently updated. Feel free to join in the discussion here at Github or email us at contact@being.se if you have any ideas, thoughts or questions!\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n- Design-centric with most standard elements exposed and ready to tweak in the Sass/CSS code\r\n- Styleguide ready for element inspection/styling, typography, and grids\r\n- Modularized CSS (layout, typography, media, etc) – just build your own components on top in their own files\r\n- Minimal code interference, cascading problems and CSS bloat\r\n- Makes as few assumptions as possible without sacrificing performance and stable code/scaffold\r\n- High-performance: loads CSS, scripts and fonts asyncronously, and lazy-loads images responsively\r\n- Responsive and print: should be good to go for both, but we always make very specific changes inhouse for these kinds of matters depending on the web project\r\n\r\n## Install instructions\r\nAll of these instructions are for commands in the Terminal (Mac) or similar command-line interface on your system of choice.\r\n\r\n### 1. Clone Only to your computer\r\n```git clone https://github.com/beingstudio/only.git```\r\n\r\n### 2. Install Bower and NPM if you haven't already done so\r\n```npm install bower -g```\r\n\r\n```npm install npm -g```\r\n\r\n### 3. Install NPM dependencies\r\n```npm install```\r\n\r\n### 4. Install Bower dependencies\r\n```bower install```\r\n\r\n### 5. Ready to go!\r\nOnly 2.1 and later versions have a Gulp workflow in mind, but it works just as well with Codekit—or if you feel like it—you could always be really old-school and go about your business without any additional tooling at all. Styles are written in Sass (SCSS) and Only also inserts PostCSS in the dependencies. Note that assets are minified and may be hard to work with, using a plain vanilla approach!\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n`gulp` — Default task is `watch`.\r\n\r\n`gulp watch` — Builds the site into `/app`, runs the `sass` function, starts Browsersync, and watches for changes to files (reloading the page when needed).\r\n\r\n`gulp sass` — Runs Sass/PostCSS and a range of tasks to create a minified CSS file.\r\n\r\n`gulp eslint` — Runs Babel (outputs concatenated JS file), then ESLint on the `scripts/all` folder which is Babel's output path.\r\n\r\n`gulp browsersync` — Start Browsersync from the `/app` folder.\r\n\r\n`gulp browsersync:production` — Start Browsersync from the `/dist` folder.\r\n\r\n`gulp build` — Runs Critical and Parker to build out additional assets.\r\n\r\n`gulp build:production` — Runs a range of tasks to build out a production version into the `/dist` folder.\r\n\r\n`gulp deploy` — Uses Rsync to upload your site.\r\n\r\n`gulp zip` — Archives the `dist` folder into a ZIP file named `archive_` and suffixed with the current time and date.\r\n\r\n## Roadmap to Only 3.0\r\nThe main goal of Only 3.0 is to provide a framework that is just as well suited to static web design and development as it is to small-scale and mid-scale web application development. I feel like Only 2.0 is good at the more static or classic side, but want to make sure it scales to modern and more complex development just as well.\r\n\r\nMost of the heavy features are expected to be incrementally added throughout version 2, with focus post 2.5 (or so) being stabilization and more frequent daily use of the framework to provide leads on what should be fixed, removed, improved and otherwise changed before the final Only 3.0 release (expected winter 2016/2017).\r\n\r\n## Pre-installed libraries\r\n### CSS/SCSS\r\nUses bits and pieces from [HTML 5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com) and incorporates [Normalize](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) 4.2.0 in `_reset.scss`.\r\n\r\n### Javascript\r\nThe file `scripts.min.js` loads minified versions of:\r\n\r\n- [LoadCSS](https://github.com/filamentgroup/loadCSS) 1.2.0\r\n- [Font Face Observer](https://github.com/bramstein/fontfaceobserver) 2.0.1\r\n- [HTML5Shiv](https://github.com/aFarkas/html5shiv) 3.7.3\r\n- [Respimage](https://github.com/aFarkas/respimage) 1.4.2\r\n- [Lazysizes](https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes) 2.0.0\r\n- [Fastclick](https://github.com/ftlabs/fastclick) 1.0.6\r\n- [Fragment.js](http://danielrapp.github.io/fragment.js/)",
